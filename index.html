                            <p>The Season of Hope<br>

                                Five months. One hundred and fifty days of learning to breathe again after my heart had been shattered into fragments so
                                small I thought they'd never reassemble. Five months of staring at my reflection and whispering affirmations I didn't
                                quite believe: "You are worthy of love. You are enough. You will find someone who sees your light."
                                The mirror in my bedroom became my confessional, witness to countless nights where I traced the outline of my lips and
                                wondered if they would ever speak words of love again. My bed, once a sanctuary shared with dreams of forever, had
                                become an island where I floated alone, teaching myself that solitude was not synonymous with loneliness.
                                But the heart, that stubborn muscle, beats with eternal optimism. It convinced me I was ready. Ready to plant new seeds
                                in the garden of my affections. Ready to believe that somewhere in this world of temporary connections and disposable
                                love, there existed someone who would treasure what I had to offer.
                                I was twenty-two, young enough to believe in fairy tales, old enough to know that princes don't always wear crowns. When
                                he appeared in my life let's call him Greg, though his name tastes like ash on my tongue now he seemed like the answer
                                to prayers I'd been too afraid to speak aloud.
                                Eleven years my senior, with the kind of confidence that comes from experience, or so I thought. His words were honey,
                                his attention a warm blanket on cold nights of doubt. "You're different," he would say, and my foolish heart would dance
                                because isn't that what every woman wants to hear? That we're not just another face in the crowd of his past?
                                The first month felt like floating. Text messages that made me blush in the middle of grocery store aisles. Phone calls
                                that stretched into the early hours of morning, where we painted pictures of our future with words dipped in hope. He
                                spoke of stress in his life, of how meeting me had been a beacon of light in his darkness. I wore his compliments like
                                jewelry, each "beautiful" and "special" adding to my collection of reasons to believe this time would be different.
                                I started leaving pieces of myself in his space a hair tie on his nightstand, a book I wanted him to read, the scent of
                                my perfume lingering on his pillows. These small territories I claimed in his world felt like promises, like the first
                                sketches of the life we were going to build together.
                                But love, real love, doesn't hide. It doesn't tuck you away in corners or erase evidence of your existence.<br>

                                <br> The Withering <br>
                                <br> The shift was so subtle at first, I convinced myself I was imagining it. The way his eyes wouldn't quite meet mine after
                                we made love. How his phone would buzz with notifications he'd quickly silence, turning the screen face down like it
                                held state secrets. His responses to my messages began arriving hours later, stripped of the warmth that once made my
                                heart skip.
                                I found my hair tie gone from his nightstand. My book vanished from his coffee table. When I asked about them, he
                                shrugged with the indifference of someone discussing the weather. "I tidied up," he said, but his apartment wasn't
                                cleaner I was simply being erased.
                                The woman's intuition they speak of isn't mystical it's survival. Every female ancestor who lived long enough to pass
                                down her genes learned to read the signs when a man's attention wandered. My body knew before my mind accepted it: there
                                was someone else. Maybe several someone elses. I was being rotated through his life like a seasonal wardrobe brought out
                                when convenient, stored away when not needed.
                                Sleep became elusive. I would lie awake at night, my phone beside me like a prayer book, waiting for messages that came
                                less frequently. When they did arrive, they felt rehearsed, like lines from a play he'd performed too many times. The
                                spontaneous midnight calls stopped altogether. The future we'd painted together began to fade like watercolors in rain.
                                I started overthinking every interaction, replaying conversations for hidden meanings. Was I being too needy? Too
                                available? I found myself performing a caricature of the "cool girl" the one who doesn't ask questions, doesn't make
                                demands, accepts whatever scraps of attention she's given with grateful silence.
                                But my heart was screaming. <br>

                                <br> The Confession of a Predator <br>
                                <br>The evening I decided to confront him, the air itself felt heavy with impending revelation. I had rehearsed the
                                conversation a dozen times, choosing my words carefully, determined to approach the situation with maturity and grace. I
                                wanted to believe that honest communication could resurrect what we had, that transparency would be the antidote to
                                whatever poison was seeping into our connection.
                                We sat in his living room, the same space where he'd once pulled me close and whispered promises against my hair. Now it
                                felt like a courtroom where I was about to receive my sentence. The words tumbled out my concerns, my observations, my
                                desperate need to understand why the man who once called me his "angel" now treated me like an inconvenience.
                                His response was a masterclass in manipulation wrapped in casual cruelty.
                                "I'm feeling stressed," he said, as if stress were a natural disaster beyond human control rather than an emotion to be
                                communicated and worked through together. "I think I need to let you go."
                                Let me go. As if I were a balloon he'd grown tired of holding, something that could simply float away without
                                consequence. The man who was supposed to be mature enough to handle adult relationships was crumbling at the first sign
                                of real intimacy, real commitment, real work.
                                But then came the confession that made my blood freeze in my veins.
                                He mentioned another woman casual as discussing the weather who claimed to be pregnant by him. The way he said it, with
                                that dismissive laugh, calling her a liar, made me realize I was staring into the face of a stranger. How many of us
                                were there? How many women had sat where I was sitting, receiving the same speech about stress and letting go?
                                "She's lying," he said with the confidence of someone who'd told himself this story so many times he'd begun to believe
                                it. "Women always lie about these things."
                                In that moment, I saw my future with crystal clarity. If I stayed, if I allowed myself to get pregnant by this man, I
                                would become another "lying woman" to the next girl who sat on his couch, receiving the same dismissive wave of his
                                hand.
                                The pregnancy scare that followed was my body's way of teaching me a lesson my heart had been too stubborn to learn. For
                                two agonizing weeks, I lived with the possibility that I might be carrying the child of a man who viewed women as
                                disposable entertainment. I had allowed him unprotected access to my body, my future, my dreams all in the name of a
                                love that had never really existed.
                                When my period finally came, I wept with relief so profound it felt like resurrection.<br>

                                <br>The Monster Unveiled<br>
                                <br>But the universe wasn't finished teaching me about the depth of his depravity.
                                The night that would become seared into my memory forever began with me in excruciating pain. Menstrual cramps that felt
                                like my body was being twisted from the inside out, waves of agony that left me gasping and pale. I had mentioned my
                                plans to go to church that morning, and he'd nodded with the absent attention of someone humoring a child's request.
                                When I woke that morning, barely able to stand from the pain radiating through my core, he was already awake, scrolling
                                through his phone with the casual indifference of someone whose day wasn't being derailed by my suffering.
                                "Are we still going to church?" I asked, my voice small and hopeful, clinging to the idea that shared faith might
                                somehow salvage what we had.
                                "Yeah, sure," he replied without looking up from his screen.
                                But as the morning wore on, his actions spoke louder than his words. When I asked if we should start getting ready, he
                                looked at me like I'd suggested we fly to the moon. When I mentioned I wasn't feeling well enough to cook breakfast, his
                                face darkened with the kind of entitlement that makes women everywhere recognize danger.
                                "I'm hungry," he said, not as a statement of fact but as a demand. As if my pain was inconvenient to his schedule, my
                                suffering an obstacle to his comfort.
                                I dragged myself to his kitchen, moving like an old woman, each step sending shockwaves through my abdomen. As I leaned
                                against the counter, trying to gather strength to prepare food I couldn't even think about eating, he continued his
                                morning entertainment TikTok videos at maximum volume, each sound bite another assault on my already fragmented
                                composure.
                                When I couldn't take the noise anymore and reached for the remote, he snatched it away with the quick reflexes of a
                                child guarding a toy. The power play was so obvious, so petty, that I almost laughed. Almost.
                                "Can I please have that?" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.
                                "No." Flat. Final. As if he was speaking to a dog who'd asked for table scraps.
                                That's when he said it. The words that would echo in my nightmares for months to come: "I could actually bully you, you
                                know."
                                The smile on his face when he said it wasn't human. It was the expression of someone who enjoyed the idea of causing
                                pain, who found pleasure in the knowledge of his physical advantage over someone already suffering.
                                "Don't try it," I warned, but my voice shook with the knowledge of my own vulnerability.
                                What happened next unfolded like a nightmare in slow motion. His hands on me, not in love but in dominance. The same
                                fingers that had once traced my face with tenderness now gripped me with the intention to intimidate. When I mentioned
                                calling security, his response was immediate and terrifying.
                                "You're manipulating me," he accused, as if my request for basic human decency was psychological warfare. "You can't
                                tell me what to do."
                                The conversation I'd asked for a simple, adult discussion about respect and boundaries became a physical altercation
                                where I was pinned, threatened, and made to feel like the villain for expecting to be treated like a human being.<br>
                                
                                <br>The Breaking Point<br>
                                When someone shows you who they are, believe them. When they pin you against a wall while you're already in pain, when
                                they use their size to intimidate you, when they make threats with smiles on their faces they are showing you your
                                future with them written in bruises and tears.
                                I locked myself in his bathroom and cried until I had no tears left. The woman in the mirror looked like a stranger
                                red-eyed, shaking, reduced to a shadow of herself by someone who was supposed to protect her heart. I thought about my
                                grandmother, who had raised me to believe I deserved to be treated like a queen. I thought about my dreams of building a
                                family built on love and respect. I thought about the little girl I once was, who believed in happily ever after.
                                That little girl deserved better than this.
                                When I finally emerged from the bathroom, he was preparing to leave, dressed in his sports clothes like nothing had
                                happened. Like he hadn't just shown me the monster beneath the mask. The casual way he moved through his morning routine
                                while I stood there, broken and traumatized, was perhaps the cruelest part of all.
                                "Can we please talk about what just happened?" I asked, my voice hoarse from crying.
                                He looked at me with the dead eyes of someone incapable of empathy. "There's nothing to talk about. Mind how you speak
                                to me."
                                Mind how I speak to him. As if my request for basic human decency was a crime worthy of punishment.
                                That's when I knew I was staring into the face of evil. Not the dramatic, movie villain kind of evil but the everyday
                                evil that lives among us, disguised as charming men who know exactly how to make women fall in love with their potential
                                while they systematically destroy our spirits.
                                I took a shower in his bathroom, washing his hands off my skin, his violence out of my hair. When I emerged, he was
                                gone. No goodbye. No acknowledgment of what had transpired. Just gone, leaving me in his space like discarded trash.
                                I gathered my things with shaking hands and walked out of his life forever.<br>
                                
                                <br> The Phoenix Rises <br>
                                The Uber ride home was a blur of city lights and tears. I stared out the window at couples walking hand in hand,
                                families heading to Sunday brunch, normal people living normal lives where love didn't come with bruises and threats. I
                                wondered how many other women were riding in cars at that very moment, fleeing from men who had shown them their true
                                faces.
                                In the days that followed, I oscillated between rage and grief. Rage at him for being exactly who he'd always been.
                                Grief for the future I'd imagined, the children I'd dreamed of giving him, the life we'd never build because he was
                                incapable of building anything lasting.
                                But slowly, something else emerged from the wreckage: clarity.
                                I began to see the patterns I'd missed, the red flags I'd painted green in my desperation for love. The way he'd never
                                introduced me to his friends, never posted about me on social media, never integrated me into his life in any meaningful
                                way. The casual mentions of other women, always described as "crazy" or "lying." The lack of empathy he showed for
                                anyone's pain but his own.
                                I realized I hadn't lost a great love I had escaped a predator.
                                The pregnancy test I took two weeks later came back negative, and I fell to my knees in gratitude. Not just for the
                                absence of a child that would have tied me to him forever, but for the presence of a strength I didn't know I possessed.
                                I had trusted my instincts. I had removed myself from danger. I had chosen myself over the fantasy of who he could have
                                been. <br>
                                <br> Letters to My Sisters <br>
                                To every young woman reading this story, searching for love in a world that often mistakes cruelty for passion,
                                manipulation for romance, possession for devotion this is my gift to you: the wisdom born from my wounds.
                                To the girl who thinks age equals maturity: A man's birthday doesn't determine his emotional development. Some men reach
                                thirty, forty, fifty, and remain emotional toddlers throwing tantrums when they don't get their way. Maturity is
                                evidenced by actions, not years.
                                To the girl who excuses red flags as "stress": Stress doesn't turn good men into abusers. It reveals who they've always
                                been beneath the surface. A man of character becomes more protective of those he loves when life gets difficult, not
                                more willing to hurt them.
                                To the girl who thinks love means accepting less: Love adds to your life. It doesn't subtract from your dignity, your
                                safety, your peace of mind, or your dreams. If you're diminishing yourself to accommodate someone else's dysfunction,
                                that's not love it's self-destruction with a romantic soundtrack.
                                To the girl who's afraid to be alone: Loneliness is temporary. Trauma from toxic relationships echoes for years. The
                                right person will be worth the wait, but you'll never recognize them if you're too busy entertaining the wrong ones.
                                To the girl who thinks she can save him: You cannot love someone into being a good person. You cannot heal someone who
                                doesn't want to be healed. Your love is not a cure for someone else's sickness it's a gift that should be treasured, not
                                a tool to be used. <br>
                                <br> The Garden Reborn <br>
                                I am learning to plant new seeds in the garden of my heart not flowers for someone else to pick, but roots for my own
                                growth. I am watering dreams that belong entirely to me: the business I want to build, the education I want to complete,
                                the woman I want to become.
                                The mirror in my bedroom is no longer a confessional but a celebration. I look at my reflection and see a survivor, a
                                warrior, a woman who chose herself when it mattered most. The scars are there invisible but real but they're not marks
                                of damage. They're proof that I lived through something that could have destroyed me and came out stronger.
                                I still believe in love. Real love. The kind that doesn't require you to shrink yourself or accept crumbs or forgive the
                                unforgivable. I believe there's someone out there who will see my story not as damage but as strength, who will love me
                                not despite my scars but because I was brave enough to get them fighting for something better.
                                But first, I'm learning to be complete on my own. To be my own rescue, my own hero, my own happily ever after. Because
                                the most dangerous thing a woman can do is build her identity around someone else's capacity to love her properly. <br>
                                <br> The Warning <br>
                                Greg will read this story someday, and he'll recognize himself in every word. He'll probably tell himself I'm just
                                another "crazy" ex, another "liar" trying to damage his reputation. He'll sleep soundly because men like him are
                                incapable of the self-reflection that leads to growth.
                                But I'm not writing this for him. I'm writing this for the next girl. The one who's receiving his sweet messages right
                                now, who's falling for his carefully crafted charm, who thinks she's different from all the rest. Maybe she'll read this
                                and recognize the patterns. Maybe she'll trust her instincts when they start screaming. Maybe she'll save herself before
                                he breaks her.
                                And I'm writing this for every woman who has ever loved someone who didn't deserve it, who has ever confused intensity
                                for intimacy, who has ever looked in the mirror after being degraded by someone she cared about and wondered if she
                                somehow deserved it.
                                You didn't deserve it. You don't deserve it. You will never deserve it.
                                Your heart is not a rehabilitation center for broken men. Your body is not a consolation prize for someone else's
                                emotional unavailability. Your dreams are not negotiable for someone who sees you as temporary entertainment.
                                Rise, sister. Dust yourself off. Lock the door behind you and throw away the key. The love you're seeking exists, but
                                it's not hiding in the arms of men who hurt you. It's waiting for you to love yourself enough to demand better.
                                This is my story. It's also my warning. It's also my gift to you.
                                Use it well.<br>
                                <br>Edina Gabriella Ngalasa.<br>
                                
                                <br>With love, solidarity, and unshakeable hope for better days,<br>
                                <br>A woman who learned that sometimes the greatest act of love is learning to walk away ❤️✨
